# 🧠 AI-Powered Product Roadmap Prioritization Tool

This project is an AI-driven platform for product managers to automate roadmap decision-making based on customer sentiment, market analysis, and internal team inputs. It integrates Airtable for structured data, Google Colab for AI and sentiment analysis, and Bubble.io for a no-code interactive dashboard.

Originally built as a master’s thesis project at Penn State, this tool automates feature scoring, prioritization, and roadmap visualization, making it easy for product teams to stay aligned with customer needs and business goals. Demonstrating how product strategy, user research, and AI can intersect to build smarter and faster product decisions.

## 🚀 Overview

Product roadmap planning often lacks structure, speed, and transparency. This tool addresses that by introducing a **feature prioritization engine** powered by sentiment analysis and weighted scoring logic.

Built using:
- **Google Colab** for data processing and AI logic (VADER for sentiment analysis)
- **Airtable** as the centralized, structured database
- **Bubble.io** to design an interactive, no-code product dashboard

The system helps product teams:
- Ingest and process user reviews, team requests, and market data
- Score features based on tunable weights (urgency, feasibility, strategic value, etc.)
- Visualize roadmap decisions in a real-time dashboard
- Reduce planning cycles by up to 30% and improve stakeholder alignment
